This dataset comprises around 2.5 million records of withdrawal data along with weather information at the time of the transactions from around 113 ATMs from the year 2017.
The actual data set is divided into two part files, both amounting to about 503 MB in total. 
There is also a data dictionary present along with the data set, which defines all of the 34 columns.
This data set contains various types of transactional data as well as the weather data at the time of the transaction, such as:
1.Transaction Date and Time: Year, month, day, weekday, hour
